# Config
This plugin was developed to bring vanilla features to PocketMine, so why does it have a config at all?
<br>Because some functions netherite normally depends on (e.g. the smithing table) are not yet implemented in PocketMine and this plugin needs a workaround for these things.
<br>For this reason, the config allows you to choose between two different types of crafting recipes for netherite items:
<br>
<br>vanilla: Diamond Sword + Netherite Ingot = Netherite Sword
<br>custom: Recipes like for all other tiers (2 Netherite Ingots + Stick = Netherite Sword)
<br>Everything else disables crafting recipes

# Icon
The icon is just a normal netherite helmet and belongs to Mojang.
